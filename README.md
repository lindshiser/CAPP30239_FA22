# CAPP 30239: Data Visualization

This is the repository for my coursework in CAPP 30239: Data Visualization. The course was offered in Fall 2022 through the [MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp) program at the University of Chicago.

This course provides an introduction to data visualization design, theory, and practice. Assignments are completed using HTML and JavaScript, namely D3s. Each week's course material corresponds to a design theory / practice. 

In-class examples and assignment deliverables (*) are linked below.
