# Final Project

For my final project, I will be visualizing technology adoption in American households throughout the 21st century.

The following sub-folders contain various project components:
- [data_raw](https://github.com/lindshiser/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/final_project/data-raw): Raw data files uploaded from their respective sources
- [data_build](https://github.com/lindshiser/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/final_project/data-build): Scripts to clean raw data in R
- [data_final](https://github.com/lindshiser/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/final_project/data-final): Cleaned data exported as csv files

## Topic Overview

As a consumer of information in the 21st century, it feels as though new technologies are quickly and consistently being adopted into American households while other technologies become obsolete. Recent technologies like computers, cell phones,  and tablets, for example, have been embraced by today's “information economy” and demand increasingly more of our time and attention.

My research will seek to answer the following questions:
- How do these recent technologies compare to older technologies, in both their rates of adoption and time usage? 
- Are Americans’ perceptions, thatour current technological landscape is ever-changing, unique to our time, or are they consistent with communication technologies of the past? 
- Can these perceptions be explained by the rate of adoption, or rather the increase in time usage compared to other technologies? 

## Data Sources

**American Time Use Survey (ATUS), *U.S. Census Bureau***

The [American Time Use Survey (ATUS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/atus.html) measures the amount of time perople spend doing various activities, such as paid work, childcare, volunteering, and socializaing. For this project, I will be using data on how much time American households report using various technologies. Data was collected as early as 2001 and as late as 2012.

**Current Population Survey (CPS), *U.S. Census Bureau***

The [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html) is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the United States. Respondents answered questions about [internet use](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/computer-internet/about.html) nearly every year from 2000-2010.

**Technology adoption in US households, *Our World in Data***

Researchers Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser at *Our World in Data* constructed a dataset compiled from multiple sources that constructs a broad overview of [technology adoption in the United States](https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption), beginning as early as 1860. For the purposes of this project, I will focus on technologies originating in the mid-20th century.
