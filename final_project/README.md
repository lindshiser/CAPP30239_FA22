# About The Project


This project was completed as part of the final course deliverable for CAPP 30239: Data Visualization. Datasets were accessed and cleaned using R. Visualizations were created using the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) JavaScript library. Page layout and style were built using HTML and CSS.

## Topic

For my final project, I visualize technology adoption and use in American households as a means of understanding the ubiquitous nature of today's communication technologies.

As a consumer of information in the 21st century, it feels as though new technologies are quickly and consistently being adopted into American households while other technologies become obsolete. Recent technologies like computers, cell phones,  and tablets, for example, have been embraced by today's “information economy” and demand increasingly more of our time and attention.

My research will seek to answer the following questions:
- How do these recent technologies compare to older technologies, in both their rates of adoption and time usage? 
- Are Americans’ perceptions, that our current technological landscape is ever-changing, unique to our time, or are they consistent with communication technologies of the past? 
- Can these perceptions be explained by the rate of adoption, or rather the increase in time usage compared to other technologies? 

## Datasets

To understand how the American population adopts and uses technologies, I used various data collected by the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/about/what.html) and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/bls/infohome.htm). Data on internet access was collected from the [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html) and the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html). Time use data was collected from the [American Time Use Survey (ATUS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/atus.html). Links to specific datasets used are included in each visualization’s caption.

Data about technology adoption was collected from research at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) on the diffusion of different technologies around the world. In their research, Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser assembled a dataset based on relevant sources shared by [Horace Dediu](http://www.asymco.com/author/asymco/), who studies technological change over time. Material used in this project was specific to American households’ adoption of communication technologies only.

## Story and Visualizations

The story expressed in this project uses insights from well-regarded population surveys to understand trends in American adoption and use of communication technologies. The scope of this project is more investigative than argumentative; it seeks to answer the same question, “Why is technology ubiquitous,” through three perspectives: adoption, access, and time. Each perspective explores and interrogates the mixed sentiment that technology is ever-present, and expanding still. This project embraces the idea that different readers may resonate with the different explanations expressed, given their own experiences with technology.

Visualizations were key to the success of this project. Chart type, interaction, color, and labels were all specially chosen to engage and inform the reader. Time was a universal theme in this project and is likewise present in all visualizations. While the section about adoption used a timeline that extended backward into the earlier 20th century, most visualizations were focused on the last two decades. This choice was made to emphasize the rapid progression of technology in recent years without forgetting that impressive technological adoption in America is not a new phenomenon.
