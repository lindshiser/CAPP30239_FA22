          <h1>America's Communication Identity, Visualized</h1>
          <h2>Understanding the ubiquitous nature of today's communication technologies</h2>

        <p>Beginning with the landline telephone and radio in the early twentieth century, Americans have acquired new technologies as a means to communicate beyond their immediate home.</p> 
        <p>Now, roughly a century after the introduction of the radio, new technologies continue to enter the market and provide Americans with alternative means of communication. Though the technology of today is much more advanced than that of a century ago, the simple purpose of communication remains largely unchanged.</p>

        <h1>Adoption of communication technologies</h1>
        <p>Americans’ adoption of new communication technologies into the home is far from a new phenomenon. What, then, is different about Americans’ present-day adoption of communication technologies compared to that of the past?</p>

      <div class="body">
        <p>For one, the rate at which technologies are entering the market has increased. The multiline chart above visualizes the share of households adopting different communication technologies over time. For much of the twentieth century, three communication technologies dominated the market: landline telephones, radios, and color televisions. Beginning in the 1990s and into the twenty-first century, new technologies like the cell phone, computer, and smartphone were introduced into American homes in quick succession, with few years to separate their introductions.</p>
        <p>The ubiquity of today’s technology, then, may be due to the sheer quantity of technologies being introduced to American homes, often separated by only a few years at a time.</p>
        <p>Despite the many years separating the introductions of technologies past and present, their rates of adoption are not entirely dissimilar. Consider the rates of adoption for different technologies in the chart above, represented by each line’s slope. The rates for both radio and the smartphone, their introductions separated by nearly a century, appear similar. It’s interesting to visualize Americans in the late 1920s buying radios at the same rate that Americans purchased smartphones in the early 2010s.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <div class="body">
        <p>Though two technologies may relate to one another in their rate of adoption, this doesn’t imply their journeys were altogether similar. Consider the added nuance of a technology’s year of introduction, related to its rate of adoption by American households. The slope chart above visualizes the share of households that adopted different technology 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years after their entrance to the market. While radios and smartphones had similar rates of adoption in their early years, smartphones were adopted into a greater proportion of households after five years on the market. Similarly, more households had adopted cell phones fifteen years after their introduction than color televisions or computers at their respective 15-year mark.</p>
        <p>Why may it be the case that some technologies are more readily adopted following their introduction than others? One possibility is the variation in ease with which a technology can be effectively adopted. Wireless technologies, like the radio, color television, or cell phone, were adopted more readily than wired technologies like the landline phone. While not included in this visualization, color television was <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption">more quickly adopted</a> than cable television. These examples illustrate how the necessity of complex installation networks can hinder a technology’s adoption into the majority of American homes.</p>

        <h1>The significance of internet access</h1>
        <p>The most important network that today’s technologies rely on is broadband internet. To understand how different communication technologies are adopted into today’s households, it’s important to consider the role and history of internet access in the United States.</p>
        <p>Access to the internet in American homes progressed dramatically in the 2000s according to data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html">Current Population Survey (CPS)</a>. In the beginning of the decade, approximately half of each state’s population had access to broadband internet in the home. By the decade’s end, roughly 75% of each state’s population had access.</p>

        <p>By 2020, internet access is now widespread across the country. The <a href=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html>American Community Survey (ACS)</a> collected data on the share of households in each county with access to broadband internet in the home. </p>

        <p>The availability of broadband internet in a community can impact residents’ interest or ability to adopt new communication technologies. Just as with landline telephones and cable television, the presence of a network to facilitate a technology’s purpose is key to the rate of its adoption. This is particularly resonant for today’s communication technologies, as many rely on broadband internet access in order to function properly. </p>
        <p>Once an internet connection is established, the potential for new communication technologies flourishes. This has been the case since the early- to mid-2010s, when smartphones were estimated to be in over half of American households. </p>
        <p>As so many of today’s technologies rely on an internet connection to function to their fullest extent, the growth in internet access over the last twenty years has surely played a role in Americans’ ability to adopt technologies. It has also expanded the uses offered by different technologies and, in turn, the amount of time Americans use them.</p>

        <h1>Time spent with communication technologies</h1>
        <p>Not only has the presence of communication technologies grown, but today’s technologies are demanding more of our time and attention. The ubiquity of today’s technologies, then, may not be because we have more technologies to choose from, but rather because today’s technologies demand more of their users.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/">American Time Use Survey (ATUS)</a>, time spent using various communication technologies has increased since 2003. Of all Americans surveyed on the amount of time they spend each day doing certain activities, the time spent on activities that involve communication technology, including watching television, using the computer, or using the phone to connect with family and friends, has increased.</p>

        <p>In the stacked bar chart above, the blue sections of bars represent watching television and movies. Dark blue represents listening to the radio, light green represents listening to music, light red represents using the phone to connect with family, and dark red represents using the phone to connect with friends.</p>
        <p>The average time Americans spend watching television and movies, for example, far surpasses the time spent on other communication-related activities. Recall that the data points used in the stacked bar graph above are yearly averages; that is, data collected from individuals who reported that they spent zero minutes doing a single activity are included in the total average minutes.</p>
        <p>The multiline chart below excludes those individuals who reported non-use (i.e. zero minutes) from the yearly averages. Watching television and movies still surpasses time spent on other activities, though the chart below more clearly visualizes the trends in time spent on other communication-related activities.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <div class="body">
        <p>It’s noteworthy that, while Americans are spending more time using communication technologies than ever before, they’re using them in different ways. These differences in use are reflected in the ATUS data, and help to explain the patterns over time.</p>
        <p>The ATUS <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/other-documentation/changes.pdf">updates their definitions</a> of each activity to reflect how Americans are spending their time. Consider the example of ‘watching television and movies’. What was once a clearly defined activity with little room for interpretation, now is more inclusive of the different ways Americans use the medium; streaming movies and television shows on the internet is considered to be ‘watching television and movies’ rather than, say, ‘using the computer’. Similarly, ‘listening to the radio’ now includes ‘listening to podcasts’ in its definition.</p>
        <p>Another important update, given the rise in adoption of smartphones, is that to the definitions of ‘using the phone’ to connect with friends or family. The activity, as defined by the ATUS, is not exclusive to telephone calls. It now includes facetime video and texting, for example.</p>
        <p>This expansion of definitions to include more interpretations of an activity may be one reason for the increase in time spent using communication technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic, admittedly, may be another reason as to why there was a spike in time spent on select activities in the years 2020-2021. </p>
        <p>Regardless, data from the ATUS shows that Americans are spending more time doing activities that involve communication technologies. As such, the ubiquity of technology may be better explained by the fact that technology is being used for a wider variety of purposes, which demand more time and attention on the part of the user.</p>

        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <h2>The interests, theory, and data behind the visualizations</h2>
        <p>This project was created using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> as the final deliverable for CAPP 30239: Data Visualization. The course is offered jointly by the <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">Harris School of Public Policy and the Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>.</p>
        <p>My interest in this topic dates back to an undergraduate course I enrolled at the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>. The course, offered by the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/comm">Communication and Media Studies</a> department (COMM 271), surveyed different ‘communication revolutions’ of the past and present. It explored the role of communication processes and technologies in shaping the public and private realms of life.</p>
        <p>Since graduating, working at a media organization, and enrolling in a <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/master-public-policy-mpp">Master of Public Policy</a> degree program, I’ve become especially interested in the public perception of technology, as well as the tension between progress and the exploitation of time and attention. The book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/9781612197494/">‘How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy’</a> by artist and critic Jenny Odell was another inspiration for the underlying questions addressed in this project.</p>
        <p>The story expressed in this project uses insights from well-regarded population surveys to understand trends in American adoption and use of communication technologies. The scope of this project is more investigative than argumentative; it seeks to answer the same question, “Why is technology ubiquitous,” through three perspectives: adoption, access, and time. Each perspective explores and interrogates the mixed sentiment that technology is ever-present, and expanding still. This project embraces the idea that different readers may resonate with the different explanations expressed, given their own experiences with technology.</p>
        <p>Visualizations were key to the success of this project. Chart type, interaction, color, and labels were all specially chosen to engage and inform the reader. Time was a universal theme in this project and is likewise present in all visualizations. While the section about adoption used a timeline that extended backward into the earlier 20th century, most visualizations were focused on the last two decades. This choice was made to emphasize the rapid progression of technology in recent years without forgetting that impressive technological adoption in America is not a new phenomenon.</p>
        <p>To understand how the American population adopts and uses technologies, I used various data collected by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/about/what.html">United States Census Bureau</a> and the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/infohome.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a>. Data on internet access was collected from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html">Current Population Survey (CPS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html">American Community Survey (ACS)</a>. Time use data was collected from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/atus.html">American Time Use Survey (ATUS)</a>. Links to specific datasets used are included in each visualization’s caption.</p>
        <p>Data about technology adoption was collected from research at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> on the diffusion of different technologies around the world. In their research, Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser assembled a dataset based on relevant sources shared by <a href="http://www.asymco.com/author/asymco/">Horace Dediu</a>, who studies technological change over time. Material used in this project was specific to American households’ adoption of communication technologies only.</p>
        <p>The only personally sourced data used in this project was the years of origin for different communication technologies. This data was included as a means to understand the diffusion of technologies at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years after their introduction on the market. Because the focus of this project was on the adoption of popular technologies in American households, rather than their initial diffusion into industry or business, years of origin represent the time at which a technology was widely available and accessible to the American public. For example, while the first smartphone was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon">invented in 1994-1995 by IBM</a>, the year of origin used in this project was 2007, when the first-generation iPhone was introduced by Apple. Data was collected via online search queries for <a href="https://www.cengn.ca/information-centre/innovation/timeline-from-1g-to-5g-a-brief-history-on-cell-phones/">cell phones</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/color-television">color televisions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer">computers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_broadcasting">radios</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">smartphones</a>. More authoritative data on the years of origins for these technologies could strengthen this project’s findings.</p>
        <p>Datasets were accessed and cleaned using R. Visualizations were created using the D3.js JavaScript library. Page layout and style were built using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Credit goes to course instructor Tiffany France, who presented 10 weeks’ worth of design theory lectures and coding tutorials that inspired this project and its underlying code.</p>
