I am a second-year MPP student at the Harris School of Public Policy. I am pursuing the Certificate in Data Analysis and hope to work in applied policy research following graduation from the Harris School. 

This summer, I was a Bartlett Fellow with the Energy Policy Institute at UChicago (EPIC). I worked with Professor Kim Wolske on her research at the intersection of energy policy and behavioral science. 

Prior to attending Harris, I worked in Development at the NPR Headquarters in Washington, DC. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2018 with a degree in Communication Studies and Organizational Studies. I'm a big fan of visual journalism.
